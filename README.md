# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-MLP-vs-CNN
This project develops deep learning models using multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition. It focuses on improving classification accuracy and reducing overfitting with techniques like Dropout, L2 Regularization, and Early Stopping, using the Digits dataset from scikit-learn.
